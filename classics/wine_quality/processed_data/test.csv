1266,US,"Reduced on the nose, this wine has a nuttiness and a petrol-like quality that colors its otherwise thin dried plum flavor. Low in oak, it will pair well with traditional Italian fare.",Estate St. Helena Vineyard,85,32.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,Sangiovese,Benessere
1277,Spain,"Pine notes and an aroma akin to floor polish make for an iffy start. This carries a slight chemical flavor as it moves along, while honey and brown-sugar notes sweeten things up. A chunky, obtuse finish feels sticky due to mild acidity.",Vendimia Tardia Single Vineyard,85,30.0,Northern Spain,Navarra,,Moscatel,Ochoa
1289,US,"A large production offering, this white is simple and direct in its expression of the variety, remaining steely and low in oak on the palate, with a depth of green apple and melon fruit.",,85,20.0,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Chardonnay,Decoy
1291,France,"Powerful and structured, this has dense tannins that will always be an important part of the wine.

1322,US,"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced.

1392,Argentina,"Raspberry and plum aromas start with a resiny oak covering that turns foresty and briary with airing.
